This project is a frontend demonstration of a form using the Bootstrap framework, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Maps JavaScript & Places APIs, and reCaptcha v2.

What this form does is takes some inputs (name, address, email, etc.) and saves all of this information in the session for the following page to be redisplayed in order to help the user verify the information. There is also Google Maps used for the address to help the user show what address they aimed for as well as reCaptcha v2 in the survey page itself in order to prevent botting. There is no backend for this project since as previously stated, this is just a frontend demonstration of a form.

Aside from session storage being used to transfer the inputted data between pages, no data is saved in the longterm.

The code is documented and there will also be a blurb of the technologies I used in the documentation.pdf file as well as the actual pdf of the assignment requirements in the documentation folder.
